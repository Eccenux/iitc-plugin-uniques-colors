# IITC plugin: uniques-colors

This is an overwrite for uniques highlighter providing more distinct highlights of uncapture portals.

With this plugin enabled unvisited portals will have red filling and uncaptured will have golden filling. Both a bit less opaque then in the original. Captured portals will be almost invisible. You will still be able to see were they are if you have e.g. Portal Levels layer.

Assuming you already have IITC just [install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-uniques-colors/raw/master/uniques-colors.user.js).
